 **The project aims to describe composition and evolution of *ipaH* genes, effectors of Type 3 secretion system, in pathogens of different hosts.**
 These genes are key factors of *Shigella* invasion that which are used for disease genotyping. Until recently, Shigella were thought to be primate-restricted pathogens. However, recent genomic studies confirmed ipaH genes in genome of Escherichia marmotae, a potential marmot pathogen, and of an E. coli extracted from fecal samples of bovine calves, suggesting that non-human hosts may also be infected by these potentially pathogenic to humans strains. We employ a computational approach to predict whether different Escherichia may also be an infectious agent of non-human hosts, which, therefore, may serve as a reservoir of human pathogens and virulence genes.

 **The project aims to investigate the patterns on genomic repeats across the circular bacterial chromosome to reveal interplay between chromosome topology and gene paralogization.**
 Copy number variation is the important genomic trait associated with bacterial phenotype. In particular, number of rRNA gene operons is species-specific and supposed to be associated with ecological niches. On the other hand, such genomic repeats provide substrates for intra-genomic recombination leading to genome rearrangements. We assume that recombination events as well as composition of genomic repeats are shaped by selection forces balancing profit and damages on different levels of chromosome organization.

 Most bacterial genomes have a single chromosome that may be supplemented by a few smaller,
 dispensable plasmids. But approximately 10% of the bacteria with completely sequenced genome,
 mostly pathogens and plant symbionts, have essential megaplasmids and/or chromids.  However, the advantages of multi­chromosomal genome organiza­tion remain unclear.

 **Term course 'Comparative Genomics of Prokaryotes'**
 
 The course covers basic and advanced topics of comparative genomics necessary for deep analysis of bacterial genomes such as genomic databases, functional annotation and orthologs prediction, pangenomics, phylogenetic analysis, prediction of regulatory elements, annotation of genomic rearrangements, and ancestral reconstruction. The lectures include an overview of the biological processes and models, summary of popular approaches and software and scientific context and recent papers in the field. Practice part comprises a set of home assignments which would require basic programming skills. The participants will get an overview of evolutionary processes at genome level and be able to analyze the genomic data in the context of both theoretical and practical genomics problems.
