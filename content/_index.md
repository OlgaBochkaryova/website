## Research interests
My research interests cover various topics of microbial genomics from fundamental questions of genome organization and evolution to their applications for human health and climate change problems. I combine evolutionary and genomics approaches, development of new bioinformatic tools and system biology experiments to study the molecular mechanisms and selection forces
shaped bacterial genome architecture and colony composition.

My [current projects](https://www.bochkareva.me/research/) are focused on:
- architecture of bacterial chromosomes: genome rearrangements, horizontal gene transfer, homologous recombination, multi-chromosome bacterial species;
- prediction of genotype-phenotype connections: virulence, antibiotic resistance, host-microbe interections
- heteroigenity of bacterial communities: phase variation mechanisms, colony fitness and adaptation
