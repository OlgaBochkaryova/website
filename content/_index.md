## Research interests
Bacterial genomes hide rapid and reversible mechanisms, commonly called ‘phase variation’, responsible for switching of gene expression and lead to genetic/phenotypic heterogeneity of pure bacterial cultures. Although independent phase-variable genes are reported in many species, phase-variable loci, which modulate expression of many genes and produce a mixed population expressing multiple allelic variants, remains under-investigated. How many genotypes are present simultaneously in a pure bacterial colony? What is responsible for the rates of genotype switching in a one cell line? What are the limitations of the classic model ‘one bacterial colony - one genome’ which is still a basis of genome assemblers?

I’m working on the intersection of comparative genomics, algorithmic biology, and evolutionary biology to build a deep understanding of bacterial genome organization and the molecular mechanisms providing complex dynamic genotype-phenotype connections. To tackle my research goals, I created a synthesis between theory and experimentation under the confines of a single laboratory combining the computational methods developed by myself and experimental assays of engineered cultures performed in collaborations with top-ranked scientists. Mainly working on fundamental knowledge about bacterial genome complexity, I create efficient pipelines which might be used as a basis for clinical and industrial applications.
