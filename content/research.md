**The project aims to develop bioinformatic software to detect large-sclae genomic variants in bacterial genomes and linked them with bacterial phenotypes.**
We have developed a strategy for extract information form genomic data to detect parallel
rearrangements in bacterial populations. The approach will be used for the study of rapid emergence of new bacterial phenotypes, understanding the molecular basis of antibiotic
resistance mechanisms and formation of small colony variants, and the
study of the selective forces in genomic evolution underlying complex
phenotypes. The application of this approach and the concomitant
understanding of connections between detected genome rearrangements
and medically-relevant phenotypes may contribute to the efficient
development of drugs and vaccines.

**The project aims to describe composition and evolution of *ipaH* genes, effectors of Type 3 secretion system, in pathogens of different hosts.**
These genes are key factors of *Shigella* invasion that which are used for disease genotyping. Until recently, Shigella were thought to be primate-restricted pathogens. However, recent genomic studies confirmed ipaH genes in genome of Escherichia marmotae, a potential marmot pathogen, and of an E. coli extracted from fecal samples of bovine calves, suggesting that non-human hosts may also be infected by these potentially pathogenic to humans strains. We employ a computational approach to predict whether different Escherichia may also be an infectious agent of non-human hosts, which, therefore, may serve as a reservoir of human pathogens and virulence genes.

### Role of gene paralogs in bacterial chromosome maintainance

**The project aims to investigate the patterns on genomic repeats across the circular bacterial chromosome to reveal interplay between chromosome topology and gene paralogization.**
Copy number variation is the important genomic trait associated with bacterial phenotype. In particular, number of rRNA gene operons is species-specific and supposed to be associated with ecological niches. On the other hand, such genomic repeats provide substrates for intra-genomic recombination leading to genome rearrangements. We assume that recombination events as well as composition of genomic repeats are shaped by selection forces balancing profit and damages on different levels of chromosome organization.

### Origin and evolution of the multichromosome bacterial genomes

**The project aims to understand organization and evolutionary benefits of bacterial genomes with secondary replicons.**
Most bacterial genomes have a single chromosome that may be supplemented by a few smaller,
dispensable plasmids. But approximately 10% of the bacteria with completely sequenced genome,
mostly pathogens and plant symbionts, have essential megaplasmids and/or chromids.  However, the advantages of multi­chromosomal genome organiza­tion remain unclear.
