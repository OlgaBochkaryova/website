The service identifies protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA genes, assigns functions to the genes, predicts which subsystems are represented in the genome, uses this information to reconstruct the metabolic network and makes the output easily downloadable for the user.

**üîß Tool** [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/14/2068/2390517)) - a command line software tool that can be installed on any Unix system. Prokka coordinates a suite of existing software tools to achieve a rich and reliable annotation of genomic bacterial sequences. Where possible, it will exploit multiple processing cores, and a typical bacterial genome can be annotated in ‚àº10 min on a quad core desktop computer. It is well suited to iterative models of sequence analysis and integration into genomic software pipelines.

**üîß Tool** [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) ([paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848648/)) - a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program, focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives.

**üåç WebTool** [PaperBLAST](https://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/litSearch.cgi) ([paper](https://msystems.asm.org/content/2/4/e00039-17))  -  web tool uses EuropePMC to search the full text of scientific articles for references to genes. PaperBLAST also takes advantage of curated resources (Swiss-Prot, GeneRIF, and EcoCyc) that link protein sequences to scientific articles. PaperBLAST‚Äôs database includes over 700,000 scientific articles that mention over 400,000 different proteins. Given a protein of interest, PaperBLAST quickly finds similar proteins that are discussed in the literature and presents snippets of text from relevant articles or from the curators.

**üåç WebTool** [InterProScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/) ([paper]()) - a resource that provides functional analysis of protein sequences by classifying them into families and predicting the presence of domains and important sites. To classify proteins in this way, InterPro uses predictive models, known as signatures, provided by several collaborating databases (referred to as member databases) that collectively make up the InterPro consortium. A key value of InterPro is that it combines protein signatures from these member databases into a single searchable resource, capitalising on their individual strengths to produce a powerful integrated database and diagnostic tool. InterPro integrates signatures from the following 13 member databases: CATH, CDD, HAMAP, MobiDB Lite, Panther, Pfam, PIRSF, PRINTS, Prosite, SFLD, SMART, SUPERFAMILY AND TIGRfams. 

## alignments

**üîß Tool** [MACSE](https://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/macse/) - a tool aligns coding NT sequences with respect to their AA translation while allowing NT sequences to contain multiple frameshifts and/or stop codons. MACSE is hence the first automatic solution to align protein-coding gene datasets containing non-functional sequences (pseudogenes) without disrupting the underlying codon structure. It has also proved useful in detecting undocumented frameshifts in public database sequences and in aligning next-generation sequencing reads/contigs against a reference coding sequence.

## orthologs

A key utility provided by Piggy is the detection of highly divergent (‚Äúswitched‚Äù) intergenic regions (IGRs) upstream of genes.

**üîß Tool** [PanACoTA](https://github.com/gem-pasteur/PanACoTA) ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/3/1/lqaa106/6090162)) - a tool that allows to download all genomes of a species, build a database with those passing quality and redundancy controls, define uniform annotation, and use them to build a pangenome, several variants of core or persistent genomes, their alignments, and a rapid but accurate phylogenetic tree. While many programs have become available in the last few years to build pangenomes, we have focused on a method that tackles all the key steps of the process, from download to phylogenetic inference.

## whole-genome alignment

**üîß Tool** [SibeliaZ]([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19777-8)) - an algorithm for identifying collinear blocks in closely related genomes based on analysis of the de Bruijn graph, incorporated into a multiple whole-genome alignment pipeline. Instruction how to construct synteny blocks with given length threshold [here](https://github.com/ctlab/parallel-rearrangements/blob/master/BLOCKS-OBTAIN.md)

**üîß Tool** [ProgressiveMauve](http://darlinglab.org/mauve/mauve.html) ([paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20593022)) is a system for constructing multiple genome alignments in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement and inversion. The alignment display is organized into one horizontal ‚Äúpanel‚Äù per input genome sequence. Each genome‚Äôs panel contains the name of the genome sequence, a scale showing the sequence coordinates for that genome, and a single black horizontal center line. Colored block outlines appear above and possibly below the center line. Each of these block outlines surrounds a region of the genome sequence that aligned to part of another genome, and is presumably homologous and internally free from genomic rearrangement. However, the algorithm‚Äôs compute time scales cubically in the number of genomes to align, making it unsuitable for datasets containing more than 50-100 bacterial genomes.

## rearrangements

**üìÑ Review** Elise Darmon, David R. F. Leach [Bacterial Genome Instability](https://mmbr.asm.org/content/78/1/1) Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews Mar 2014, 78 (1) 1-39

GC Skew is a phenomenon observed in many bacterial genomes wherein the two strands of the chromosome contain different proportions of guanine/cytosine nucleotides. SkewIT quantifies GC Skew using a single metric that can then be compared/analyzed across thousands of bacterial genomes.

**üåç WebTool** [YASS](https://bioinfo.lifl.fr/yass/yass.php) ([paper](https://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/suppl_2/W540)) - a DNA local alignment tool based on an efficient and sensitive filtering algorithm. It applies transition-constrained seeds to specify the most probable conserved motifs between homologous sequences, combined with a flexible hit criterion used to identify groups of seeds that are likely to exhibit significant alignments.

**üîß Tool** [PAREBRICK](https://pypi.org/project/PaReBrick/) ([paper]) - a  tool  to  identify  parallelrearrangements in bacterial population. It takes synteny blocks and a phylogenetic tree as input and outputs rearrangement events, such as inversions, insertions, deletions and multiplications. The tool tests each rearrangement for consistency with a tree and sorts the events by their parallelism score. As various molecular mechanisms might be responsible for variations in blocks content,  the tool provides diagrams of the neighbors for each block of interest allowing the detection of horizontally transferred blocks or its extra copies as well as the inversions in which copied blocks are involved.
